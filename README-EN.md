# trippr (`/ˈtrɪpɜr/`)

AR Project developed during 2016's SESI Hackathon by the NAVE Rio group. Developed for Android in Unity3D.

## Description

The app allows for the recognition of bank notes of a range of countries through the camera and offers the conversion of
the currency in real time. That way, there is no need to search for the currency name, country, value, or to what currency
you want to convert to. You just have to point the camera, and you're set! You get instant feedback of the exact value
at hand!

It is currently in development stage and only supports US dollar and Brazilian real.

## Future plans

There is planning for the implementation of the Google Places API, to indicate nearby currency exchange houses. Besides,
graphics of the fluctuation of trade costs and support for more currencies are on our TODO list.
